\section{Supplementary Methods}
\label{sec:meth}

\subsection{Data}
Total $^{234}$Th (particulate+dissolved) activity are obtained by compiling data from GEOTRACES \citep{mawji2015,schlitzer2018} and from published reference (Table S1).
Globally, we have a total of 3723 measurements from the literature and 2262 from US GEOTRACES.
After binning these observations into the grid of the Ocean Circulation Inverse Model (OCIM) (2$^\circ\times$ 2$^\circ$ resolution with 24 vertical levels), there are 2521 grid boxes with $^{234}$Th measurements (Fig. 1).
$^{234}$Th based upper ocean ($<$150 m) POC flux data are from https://www.pangaea.de/ \citep{LeMoigne2013}, with new data from \citet{Black2017}.
The inverse model also uses salinity, phosphate, and net primary production (NPP) data.
The salinity and inorganic phosphorus data are from World Ocean Atlas 2013 \citep{Zweng2013,Garcia2014}.
Net primary production (NPP) data used to parameterize biological phosphate uptake are satellite-derived carbon based primary production data (MODIS CbPM) \citep{Westberry2008}.
Sediment POC flux data are downloaded from https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.855600 \citep{mouw2016}, and are binned into the grid of OCIM.

\subsection{Circulation and particle sinking models}
Dissolved $^{234}$Th and phosphate are transported by advection and diffusion that are modeled using an advection-diffusion transport operator, $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{T}}$, defined so that $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{T}}[C] \equiv \nabla \cdot \left(\vec{U}[C]-\mathbf{K}\nabla [C]\right)$.
This operator was optimized using multiple tracers, including salinity, temperature, sea surface height, CFC11, pre-bomb radiocarbon, and phosphate \citep{DeVries2011,Primeau2013}.
Element concentrations are denoted using square bracket (e.g. [C]).
The vertical transport of particulate $^{234}$Th and particulate organic phosphorus is modeled using a particle flux divergence operator that is built based on the power law attenuation function known as Martin curve \citep{fu2017}.
The Martin curve exponential $b$ values are optimized in inversion,

\subsection{Bayesian optimization}
We obtain P and Th fields by solving the governing equations for P and Th(Eqs.1-3).
The governing equations for P-cycle model are linear, and thus can be solved using direct matrix inversion.
With POP concentration from the P model, the Th equations are also linear, and are therefore solved by direct matrix inversion.
We minimize the difference between model outputs and observations by optimizing a set of parameters controlling P and Th cycle using the following objective function.
\begin{align*}
f = e_{\textrm{P}}{'}\frac{1}{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{W_P}}}e_\textrm{P} + e_{\textrm{Th}}^{'}\frac{1}{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{W_{Th}}}}e_{\textrm{Th}},
\end{align*}
where $ e_{\textrm{Th}} = \textrm{log(Th}_{\textrm{mod}})-\textrm{log(Th}_{\textrm{obs}})$ and $e_{\textrm{P}} = \textrm{log(DIP}_{\textrm{mod}})-\textrm{log(DIP}_{\textrm{obs}})$.
$\boldsymbol{\mathsf{W_{Th}}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{W_{P}}}$ are weighing matrices for $^{234}$Th and DIP. $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{W_{Th}}}$ is defined using the following equation,
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{\mathsf{W_{Th}}} = \frac{1}{\sigma^2_{\textrm{Th}}}\boldsymbol{\mathsf{V}},
\end{align*}
where $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{V}}$ is grid-box fractional volumes, and $\sigma_{\textrm{Th}}$ is defined,
\begin{align*}
\sigma^2_{\textrm{Th}} = (\textrm{log(Th}_{\textrm{mod}})-\mu_{\textrm{Th}})'\boldsymbol{\mathsf{V}}(\textrm{log(Th}_{\textrm{mod}})-\mu_{\textrm{Th}})
\end{align*}
with
\begin{align*}
\mu_{\textrm{Th}} = \frac{\Sigma({\textrm{log(Th}_{\textrm{obs}})\boldsymbol{\mathsf{V_{Th}}}})}{\Sigma{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{V_{Th}}}}},
\end{align*}
where $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{V_{Th}}}$ is grid box volume, and the subscript Th represents the grid boxes with $^{234}$Th observations.
The DIP weighing matrix $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{W_{P}}}$ is defined similarly.

The optimization is conducted using a matlab function fminunc, which is efficient because we are able to supply the first and second derivatives.
The optimization are generally finish within 100 iterations.
The optimal model parameters are presented in Table S\ref{tab:parameters} and Fig. S\ref{fig:b}.
Parameter errorbars that correspond to $\pm$1 standard deviation, are calculated according to \cite{Wang2019}


\subsection{Error estimation}
The error estimation is conducted using Monte Carlo method. Errors are considered from three major sources.
1) model parameters and associated error bars, 2) C:P ratio that is used to convert total phosphorus export to carbon export, 3) POC to $^{234}$Th ratio.
For each iteration, parameters are randomly drawn from a normal distribution with mean defined by optimal model parameters and variance defined by the covariance matrix (second derivative Hessian matrix evaluated at optimal parameter values).
C:P ratio from Teng et al is randomly selected from a space that constrained by the errorbar ranges for each region.
POC to $^{234}$Th ratio is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean defined by POC:Th = $135.3z^{-0.795}$ at $z = 114 $m and a variance of 0.25, which creates a range between $\sim$2.3 to $\sim$4.0 that is consistent to Fig. 8 of Ref.\citep{Owens2015}.
In the Monte Carlo analysis, we recalculate carbon export fluxes based on parameters from each random drawn.
The median values and 95\% confidence intervals are based{} on a sample size of 1000.

\subsection{Sensitivity tests}
In the model, we use particulate organic phosphorus [POP] as a proxy for sinking particles that carries $^{234}$Th out of the surface ocean.
We acknowledge that phosphorus is a small portion of sinking particles, other components, such as particulate organic carbon, opal, and calcium carbonate, also absorb dissolved thorium.
Here we run multiple sensitivity tests to demonstrate that our model is robust to $R_{M:P}$, sinking mass to phosphorus ratio.

In the first test, we converted POP to POC by applying spatially variable C:P ratios based on \cite{Galbraith2015}.
We tested if the converted [POC] is a better proxy for the sinking particles because carbon is a larger portion of sinking particles compared to phosphorus.
However, we reject this model based on its poor model versus observation fittings (Fig. S\ref{fig:MvsO_GB15}).
One possible reason for the poor performance is that POC may not represent sinking mass better than phosphorus.
One can image that in high productivity regions, such as the Southern Ocean, C:P ratio is low according to \cite{Galbraith2015}, but total sinking mass (summation of organic matter, calcium carbonate and opal etc.) to P ratio can be high due to high diatom activities.

In a second experiment, we formulate two equations for sinking mass to phosphorus ratio ($R_{M:P}$), in which sinking mass is proportional to ambient phosphorus concentration.
Two parameters controlling the ``slope'' ($S$) and ``intercept'' ($R_{min}$) are optimized in the inversion (Eq. 3).

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  &R_{M:P} = R_{min}+S(1-tanh([DIP]))\\
  &R_{M:P} = R_{min}-S[DIP]
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We found that the optimal value of $R_{min}$ correlates with adsorption and desorption rate constants, and the optimal value of $S$ is less than 1$\times$10$^{-2}$. Thus, we got virtually the same POC and DOC export patterns as the control model. Based on the current data constraints, we did not find the evidence indicating $R_{M:P}$ has spatial variations, and the gradient is too weak and can be ignored.

\section{C:P ratio of sinking particles}
With the optimal $b$ values and an assumed particle dissolution rate constant, one can estimate particle sinking velocity\citep{kriest2008}, with which POP sinking flux can be calculated given the POP distribution from the P cycle model.
We have POC sinking flux diagnosed from $^{234}$Th flux and POC/$^{234}$Th ratio.
We then compute C:P ratio of sinking particles for each region reported in \cite{Teng2014}.
The results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:C2P}.
C:P ratios in the current study are highly correlated to those of \cite{Teng2014}, and follow the general pattern that C:P ratio is high in the subtropical gyres and low in the high nutrient upwelling regions.
% \subsection{Supplementary discussion}
% The optimal parameter values are given in Table 1. DOP life time according to the estimated $\kappa_d$ is $\sim$ 300 days, which is on the same timescale of semi-labile DOP life time used in the model of \cite{letscher2015}. Model net primary production (NPP in phosphorus unit, Fig. 1b) based on optimal $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values is shown in Fig. S1. Thorium desorption rate constant (8.17$^{+13.71}_{-5.12}$ yr$^{-1}$) is in agreement with previous estimates, i.e. 1.84-13.96 yr$^{-1}$ by \cite{wang2016} and 2.6-9.8 yr$^{-1}$ by \cite{bacon1989}.
