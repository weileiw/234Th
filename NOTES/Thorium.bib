   abstract = {Marine particles are a main vector by which the biological carbon pump in the ocean transfers carbon from the atmosphere to the deep ocean. Marine particles exist in a continuous spectrum of sizes, but they can be functionally grouped into a small, suspended class (which constitutes most of the total particle mass) and a large, sinking class (which contributes most of the particle flux). These two classes are connected by aggregation and disaggregation processes. The interplay of processes that create, aggregate, and destroy marine particles determines the strength and transfer efficiency of the biological pump. Measurements of radiocarbon, barium, and organic biomarkers on suspended and sinking particles have provided qualitative insights into particle dynamics, and measurements of thorium isotopes have provided quantitative estimates of rates. Here, we review what has been learned so far about particle dynamics in the ocean from chemical measurements on suspended and sinking particles. We then discuss future directions for this approach.},

   abstract = {Understanding (230)Th distributions in the global ocean is important to support and guide the use of this important radioactive nuclide in multiple aspects of oceanographic research, and this issue is now revisited. Based on estimates of export productivity (EP) over 2003-2010 and assuming (230)Th scavenging at equilibrium at seven Pacific stations where linear (230)Th profiles are found, an empirical equilibrium-state (230)Th-scavenging versus EP correlation is established. This correlation demonstrates the relationship between (230)Th-scavenging intensity and EP in the absence of advection. With this correlation, other (230)Th profiles from global oceans are reinterpreted. My findings provide alternative explanations of signals carried by (230)Th distributions with regard to advection, by a reassessment of the (230)Th deficits in deep waters. Such an equilibrium-state (230)Th-scavenging versus EP correlation provides a basis for convenient parameterization for use in 3D modeling studies of the (230)Th distributions.},

   abstract = {Biological productivity in the equatorial Pacific is relatively high compared with other low-latitude regimes, especially east of the dateline, where divergence driven by the trade winds brings nutrient-rich waters of the Equatorial Undercurrent to the surface. The equatorial Pacific is one of the three principal high-nutrient low-chlorophyll ocean regimes where biological utilization of nitrate and phosphate is limited, in part, by the availability of iron. Throughout most of the equatorial Pacific, upwelling of water from the Equatorial Undercurrent supplies far more dissolved iron than is delivered by dust, by as much as two orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, recent studies have inferred that the greater supply of dust during ice ages stimulated greater utilization of nutrients within the region of upwelling on the equator, thereby contributing to the sequestration of carbon in the ocean interior. Here we present proxy records for dust and for biological productivity over the past 500 ky at three sites spanning the breadth of the equatorial Pacific Ocean to test the dust fertilization hypothesis. Dust supply peaked under glacial conditions, consistent with previous studies, whereas proxies of export production exhibit maxima during ice age terminations. Temporal decoupling between dust supply and biological productivity indicates that other factors, likely involving ocean dynamics, played a greater role than dust in regulating equatorial Pacific productivity.},
